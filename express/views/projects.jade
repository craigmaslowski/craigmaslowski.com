  h4 RPG Universe Online
  p
    | RPG Universe Online is a pet project of mine that never seems to get enough love.
    | I've long had a vision for a web based virtual table top to facilitate playing traditional, pen and paper style role playing games online with your friends.
    | You can follow the (sometimes up and running) progress <a href="http://rpguniverseonline.no.de" target="_blank">here</a>.
  
  h4 SocketStream
  p  
    | <a href="https://github.com/socketstream/socketstream/" target="_blank">SocketStream</a> is a new and exciting, open source realtime web application framework for Node.js.
    | I'm an active member of the SocketStream community, and a sometimes contributor to the codebase.

  p
    | SocketStream is blazing new ground, and definitely something to keep an eye on in the future.
